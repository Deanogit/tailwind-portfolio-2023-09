## Projects

- TailwindCSS - Brad Traversy
  -- Shortly App Page
  -- Responsive design with modal mobile navigation menu, built in TailwindCSS. I really like the clean layout, which looks great through a wide range of screen sizes.

  -- LoopStudios Page
  -- Striking and bold, fully responsive and interactive. I particularly like the hover animation effect on the product items.

  -- Fylo App
  -- This page has a Light and Dark Mode button, for switching the theme as and when the user may require.

  -- Bookmark App
  -- A mock-up build of a fictional start-up. Check out the interactive panel, using a little bit of JavaScript magic.

  -- Image Gallery
  -- Built using grid, with smart hover state for the links and images.

  -- Components
  -- Triple Product Cards
  -- Product Card - Reusable responsive product card with tailwind animation

  -- Login Modal

- HTML CSS - Jonas Schmedtman
  -- Omnifood Page
  -- This is the biggest project I have built to date, with over 1000 lines of CSS. It was a great learning experience. It made me aware of how useful a framework could be, in reducing the volume of code written and the merit of using design systems. This has inspired me to focus on building in TailwindCSS.

  -- Furniture Shop
  -- Looking into the finer details of building a webpage that matches the client's needs. I like the clean layout and contemporary feel.

  -- HTML page
  -- Learning the nuts and bolts of CSS layouts and HTML elements, although this design looks dated to todays standards, I like how it emulates the blocky aesthetics of webpages of old!

- HTML CSS - FreeCodeCamp
  -- Nutri Card
  -- I really enjoyed this project, learning how to emulate designs that I am familiar with in print to building for the web. The strong graphic qualities of the layout, type and monotone palette are very pleasing for me!

  -- Forms
  -- Getting to grips with forms, one of the key ways for websites to gather information and data from their users in an interactive way. I enjoyed learning how these forms work behind the scenes.

  -- Tables
  -- Not used so much these days, tables were one of the ways web developers laid out pages in the past, no CSS Grid or Flexbox, just good old <Tables>!

- HTML CSS - FrontEnd Mentor
  -- Building projects straight from figma files, FrontEnd Mentor Challenges have been one of my most satisfying and challenging ways to learn. Here are a few I've built, often not the first version or attempt, and certainly not the last (TailwindCSS versions coming soon!)

  -- Meet Landing Page
  -- Building more complex layouts, adapting to media queries and expanding skills and techniques.

  -- Four Card Flex Page
  -- Building Mobile-first, using flexbox to layout the cards and enjoying the clean layout.

  -- Nft Product Card
  -- One of the first projects built using FrontEnd Mentor, I really enjoyed building the sleek layout & design, using a modern colour palette and incorporating the hover and active states.

  -- More projects

- HTML CSS JavaScript
  -- JavaScript is the area I can grow the most, getting to grips with the DOM and writing clean efficient code are my priorities.

  -- Guess the Number Game
  -- writing the logic and manipulating the DOM were my favourite parts in building this project.

- p5.js
  -- Drawn to animations, simulations and interactivity, I'm really excited to explore the world of programming interactive computer graphics, it's not top of my list of priorities, but it's very satisfying to experiment with code on p5.js.

  -- Flocking Simulation
  -- Looking into how something like this is built with math is very exciting. Thanks and credit to Daniel Shiffman The Nature of Code for sharing his amazing work. Here I've played around with some of the values to create various effects. Click and drag your mouse to create new objects in the browser window.

  -- Floating Ball Simulation
  -- As satisfying as watching a lava-lamp, try playing around with the ball by moving your mouse.

  -- Bouncing Blobs Simulation
  -- This code is not my own, fascinating to see what is possible though! Use your mouse to animate the blobs!

- Personal Projects
  -- One of my big web dev ambitions, build my own e-commerce site, here's a sneak peak of the build so far.
